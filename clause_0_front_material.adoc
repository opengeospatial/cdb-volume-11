[big]*i.     Abstract*

This Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Standard defines the the abstract CDB data store conceptual model. The objective is to provide a core conceptual model for a CDB data store (repository). The model is represented using UML (Unified Modeling Language). The conceptual model is comprised of concepts, schema, classes and categories as well as their relationships, which are used to understand, and/or represent an OGC CDB data store. This enables a comparison and description of the CDB data store structure at a more detailed level. The model created by reverse-engineering the UML diagrams and documentation from the original CDB submission https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=61935[OGC Common DataBase Volume 1 Best Practice, 2015] as a basis for supporting OGC interoperability. One of the important roles of this conceptual model is to provide a UML model that is consistent with other OGC standards and to identify functional gaps between the current CDB data store and the OGC standards baseline.  This document references sections of Volume 1: OGC CDB Core Standard: Model and Physical Database Structure [OGC 15-113r5].

NOTE: The simulation community uses the term “synthetic environment data” to mean all the digital data stored in some database or structured data store that is required for use by simulation clients. From the geospatial community perspective, these data are essentially the same as GIS data but with, in some cases, special attributes, such as radar reflectivity.

[big]*iii.   Preface*

The industry-maintained CDB model and data store structure has been discussed and demonstrated at OGC Technical Committee meetings since September 2013. This document, the first UML conceptual model for OGC CDB Standard, is one of the fifteen documents that comprise the OGC CDB modular standard. The UML conceptual model establishes a single set of consistent concepts that could be also implemented using other encoding mechanisms.

The CDB Standard was originally based on the OGC CDB Best Practice documents, which were submitted to the OGC by CAE Inc. on behalf of the CDB implementation community and user group. The CDB Standard is currently widely implemented in the defense and aviation simulation communities. The intent is that the OGC version 1.x series of Standards be backwards compatible with existing implementations but that terminology and concepts be aligned as appropriate with the OGC technical baseline. Future work is planned to align the CDB Standard with other OGC standards and to provide Best Practices focused on how to use CDB with the existing OGC Standards baseline, such as CityGML, Web Map Service (WMS), Web Feature Service (WFS), and Web Coverage Service (WCS). The abiity to use the OGC GeoPackage Standard was defined for version 1.2 of the OGC CDB standard.

The OGC CDB Standard is based on and derived from an industry developed and maintained specification, which has been approved and published as OGC Best PracticeDocument 15-003:  OGC Common DataBase Volume 1 Main Body.  An extensive listing of contributors to the legacy industry-led CDB specification is at Chapter 11, pp 475-476 in that OGC Best Practices Document (https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=61935 ).

[big]*vii.     CDB Document Guide*

This document contains a number of annexes related to the OGC CDB Core standard.

For the purposes of being able to cross reference this OGC Best Practice with the previous versions of the CDB standard, the following annex “crosswalk” is provided.



For ease of editing and review, the standard has been separated into 15 Volumes and a schema repository.
