[big]*i.     Abstract*

This Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standard defines the conceptual model for the OGC CDB Standard. The objective of this document is to provide an core conceptual model for a CDB data store (repository). The model is represented using UML (Unified Modeling Language). The conceptual model is comprised of concepts, schema, classes and categories as well as their relationships, which are used to understand, and/or represent an OGC CDB data store. This enables a comparison and description of the CDB data store structure on a more detailed level. This document was created by reverse-engineering the UML diagrams and documentation from the original CDB submission https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=61935[OGC Common DataBase Volume 1 Best Practice, 2015] as a basis for supporting OGC interoperability. One of the important roles of this conceptual model is to provide a UML model that is consistent with the other OGC standards and to identify functional gaps between the current CDB data store and the OGC standards baseline.  This document references sections of Volume 1: OGC CDB Core Standard: Model and Physical Database Structure [OGC 15-113r5].

NOTE: The simulation community uses the term “synthetic environment data” to mean all the digital data stored in some database or structured data store that is required for use by simulation clients. From the geospatial community perspective, these data are essentially the same as GIS data but with, in some cases, special attributes, such as radar reflectivity.

[big]*iii.   Preface*

The industry-maintained CDB model and data store structure has been discussed and demonstrated at OGC Technical Committee meetings since September 2013. This document, the first UML conceptual model for OGC CDB standard, is one of the 15 documents that comprise the OGC CDB modular standard. The UML conceptual model establishes a single set of consistent concepts that could be also implemented using other encoding mechanisms.

The CDB standard is originally based on the OGC CDB Best Practice documents, which were submitted to the OGC by CAE Inc. on behalf of the CDB implementation community and user group. CDB is currently widely implemented in the defense and aviation simulation communities. The intent is that this initial OGC version of the CDB standard be backwards compatible with existing implementations but that terminology and concepts be aligned as appropriate with the OGC technical baseline. Future work is planned to align the standard with other OGC standards and to provide Best Practices focused on how to use CDB with the existing OGC standards baseline, such as CityGML, Web Map Service (WMS), Web Feature Service (WFS), and Web Coverage Service (WCS). A GeoPackage capability was defined for version 1.2 of the OGC CDB standard.

The OGC CDB standard is based on and derived from an industry developed and maintained specification, which has been approved and published as OGC Best PracticeDocument 15-003:  OGC Common DataBase Volume 1 Main Body.  An extensive listing of contributors to the legacy industry-led CDB specification is at Chapter 11, pp 475-476 in that OGC Best Practices Document (https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=61935 ).

[big]*vi.     Future Work*

The CDB community anticipates that additional standardization will be required to prescribe content appropriate to targeted simulation applications.  In its current form, the CDB standard does not mandate synthetic environmental richness, quality and resolution. In Version 1.1, additional informative clauses were incorporated that provide guidance on how to include and encode global (data store wide) and local (data set specific) geospatial metadata.

The OGC CDB Standards Working Group (SWG) members understand there is a requirement for eventual alignment of the CDB standard with the OGC/ISO standards baseline. In Version 1 of the CDB standard, effort was invested to begin aligning terminology and concepts, specifically in the coordinate reference system discussions and requirements.

The current version of the CDB standard is fully backwards compatible with version 1.0 of the CDB standard as defined and implemented by the current CDB implementer and user community. The requirements for a CDB data store are focused on the ability to store, manage, and access extremely large volumes of geographic content. In this version of the standard, initial harmonization with the OGC and ISO standards baseline has begun. For example, where appropriate, the CDB simulation community terms and definitions have been replaced with OGC/ISO terms and definitions. Further, the standards documents have been reorganized and structured to be consistent with the OGC Modular Specification Policy. However, the CDB SWG and community recognize the need to further harmonize and align this standard with the OGC baseline and other IT best practices. There has already been considerable discussion in this regard.

Based on such discussions and comments received during the public comment period, the following future work tasks are envisioned:

.	Describe explicitly how the CDB model may or may not align with the OGC DGGS standard;
.	Provide best practice details on how to use WMS, WFS, and WCS to access existing CDB data stores. This work may require Interoperability Experiments to better understand the implications of these decisions;
.	Extend the supported encodings and formats for a CDB data store to include the use of the OGC GeoPackage, CityGML, and InDoorGML standards as well as other broadly used community encoding standards, such as GeoTIFF. This work may require performing OGC Interoperability Experiments to better understand the implications of these decisions. Please note that in CDB version 1.2, GeoPackage containers can be used in a CDB data store.
.	Further align CDB terminology to be fully consistent with OGC/ISO terminology.

Making these enhancements will allow the use and implementation of a CDB structured data store for application areas other than aviation simulators.
